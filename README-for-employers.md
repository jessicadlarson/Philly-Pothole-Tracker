# Final Capstone for Tech Elevator

Tech Elevator assigned my group (myself along with Dennis Angelisanti, Steven Jenkins-Edwards and Cindy Li) this project as our final capstone. We were to implement what we learned from the past fourteen weeks and use it to build a fully-functioning website using Vue.js for the frontend and Java/PostgreSQL for the backend/database.
